# facebook_data
This some quick code I used to perform a superficial analysis of personal data I requested from Facebook.

I received my information in .json format and made extensive use of tidyverse to analyse and summarise the data. All required packages are listed in the code.

My personal data was held in a 'data' folder that is not included in this repo. 

You may find you can use the code exactly as I have written it, but quite possible tweaking will be required.
